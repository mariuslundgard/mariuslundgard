Iâ€™m a designer who approaches code and technology as a design material. That means I prefer prototyping using code â€“ with real content and real functionality â€“ over traditional static sketching or visual prototyping tools.

Iâ€™m especially interested in design systems, publishing, typography, data visualization, branding, and product innovation & strategy.
